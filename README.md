# Homelab to PROD golden path on AI using electrical-consume-weather data

This is a golden path (opinionated shortcut) to explore AI from local homelab to PROD using OSS for technological independency. 

We explore concepts like AI agents, RAG and LLM using OSS technologies like Linux, Opentofu, microk8s, DAPR, Ollama, TimescaleDB & Vectorizer, Flask and Python.
